  Una dintre primele cărți care investighează relația dintre anonimitate, troli și mainstream este <em><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12467417-epic-win-for-anonymous?ac=1&from_search=true&qid=SjgPnq0srT&rank=1">Epic Win for Anonymous: How 4chan's Army Conquered the Web</em></a> scrisă de Cole Stryker în 2011. Chiar dacă nu este cea mai academică abordare, Stryker vine cu o perspectivă din interior.

  Articolul <em><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2017/12/the-making-of-an-american-nazi/544119/">The Making of an American Nazi</a></em> publicat în The Atlantic (2017) discută, pe larg, problematica radicalizării online. Câteva puncte pe care le atunge:
</p>
<blockquote>
  In recent years, psychologists have found a powerful connection between <strong>trolling</strong> and what’s known as the “dark tetrad” of personality traits: <strong>psychopathy, sadism, narcissism, and Machiavellianism</strong>. The first two traits are significant predictors of trolling behavior, and all four traits correlate with enjoyment of trolling. Research published in June by Natalie Sest and Evita March, two Australian scholars, shows that trolls tend to be high in cognitive empathy, meaning they can understand emotional suffering in others, but low in affective empathy, meaning they don’t care about the pain they cause. They are, in short, skilled and ruthless manipulators.

<blockquote>
  The lawsuit is scheduled to enter the pretrial stage in December. <strong>It marks the first time a notorious internet troll has been sued for instigating a campaign of harassment and intimidation.</strong> It could force the courts to decide whether calling for a troll attack—Anglin’s admonition to “hit ’em up”—is protected speech. The risk, however, is that if Anglin prevails in court, sadistic trolls will be free to tear across the internet with even greater abandon.
